# v2ray-worker-sub

This repository is mainly based on Vfarid's [V2ray-worker](https://github.com/vfarid/v2ray-worker) Project, version 2.3 with a minor change to return vmess:// proxies as well as vless:// correctly. Providers include Telegram Channels and publicly available v2ray subscriptions.

# SpeedTest and Sorting

This code also uses [V2rayAggregator](https://github.com/mahdibland/V2RayAggregator) developed by Mahdibland to speedtest and sort vmess proxies.
