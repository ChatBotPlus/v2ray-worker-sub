# Vfarid-fix

Vfarid's [V2ray-worker](https://github.com/vfarid/v2ray-worker) Project returns vmess:// proxies as unsupported format for most of v2ray apps. Until he pushes a fix, this repository is mostly about fixing the output of his code.

# SpeedTest and Sorting

This code also uses [V2rayAggregator](https://github.com/mahdibland/V2RayAggregator) developed by Mahdibland to speedtest and sort vmess proxies.
